# Density Paper 2019 Experiments in R
This repository hosts the experiments we performed using our extended dataset [1] for our papers on Source Code Density [2]. It is continuously updated as we add RQs and/or experiments, results, figures etc.

It holds the raw __`R`__-notebooks and the figures we produced.
